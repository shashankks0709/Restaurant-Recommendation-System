# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
Recommender Systems or Recommendation Systems are simple algorithms that aim to provide the most relevant and accurate items (products, movies, events, articles) to the user (customers, visitors, app users, readers) by filtering useful stuff from a huge pool of information base. Recommendation engines discover data patterns in the data set by learning consumers’ choices and produces the outcomes that co-relates to their needs and interests.
Imagine a physical clothing store. The good merchant knows the personal preferences of customers. Her/His high-quality recommendations make customers satisfied and increase profits. In the case of picking a restaurant to have lunch or dinner when you are traveling to other countries or cities, commonly you will ask your friend that lives in that country or city what is the best restaurant in town. The problem is you don’t have any friends that lived in that town. Your personal recommendations can be generated by an artificial friend: the recommender system.
